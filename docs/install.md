# Installation

To use the LoTLan-Scheduler you can simply install it via the Pip package installer.
A link to pyi can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/Lotlan-Scheduler/).

You can also visit our [Github page](https://github.com/iml130/lotlan-scheduler) and build the project yourself.

You also need to have the dot renderer installed to be able to draw the PetriNets. Currently we dont support optional drawing
so you need to have it installed to run the program. The easiest way will be to install [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/).
Make sure that dot or dot.exe is in your PATH enviromnment variable.

An example of how to use the installed pip package can be found [here](./tutorials/cli.md)
